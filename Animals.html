        <h1> Animals </h1>
    <p>Camel:</p>

         <li>
            There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
        </li>

        <li>
            Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.
        </li>

        <li>
            Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
        </li>

        <li>
            Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.
        </li>

    <p>Chameleon:</p>

    </a>

    <ol>
        <li>THEIR FEET WORK LIKE SALAD TONGS.</li>
        
        <li>ALMOST HALF OF ALL KNOWN SPECIES LIVE IN MADAGASCAR.</li>
        <li>CHAMELEONS VARY WILDLY IN TERMS OF SIZE.</li>
        <li>THEY MAINLY CHANGE COLOR IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE OR REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE.</li>
        <li>SKIN CRYSTALS ENABLE THEM TO CHANGE COLOR AT WILL.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cicada:</p>
    <a href= "http://origami.me/cicada/">
        <img src="cicada.png" width = 180 height = 240>
    </a>

    <ol>
        <li>Cicadas are found throughout the U.S. (and many parts of the world), but periodical cicadas — the species that emerge above ground only every few years — live primarily in the eastern and central U.S., according to National Geographic. </li>
        <li>There are around 3,000 cicada species, according to National Geographic, so they vary in size from 0.75 to 2.25 in (2.2 to 5.5 cm) long. Cicadas can be black, brown or green and can have red, white or blue eyes.</li>
        <li>Though a group of these insects are called a cloud or plague, cicadas usually don't cause the harm that locusts cause to crops and local vegetation. Cicadas are herbivores. This means they eat vegetation. Young cicadas eat liquid from plant roots, while molting cicadas eat twigs. Adult cicadas do not feed, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture.        </li> 
        <li>The buzzing sound they make is a mating call. Male cicadas vibrate a white, drumlike membrane on their abdomens called a tymbal. A group of singing cicadas is called a chorus. The singing attracts both males and females to a certain area. The males join in on the singing and the females mate with the males. </li> 
        <li>While no species of cicada are endangered, a few are at risk, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The union's Red List of Threatened Species lists the Cassini periodical cicada, the Decim periodical cicada and the Decula periodical cicada as lower risk/near threatened, although no reasons for those assessment are given.        </li>

    <p>Panda:</p>
    <a href= "http://origami.me/panda/">
        <img src="panda.png" width = 180 height = 240>
    </a>
<br>
<br>
     <ol>
<li>A giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear.</li>
<li>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.</li>
<li>Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown).</li>
<li>Pandas have so many fans because they look cute.</li>
<li>Pandas are "lazy" — eating and sleeping make their day.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Pigeon:</p>
<a href= "http://origami.me/pigeon/">
    <img src="pigeon.png" width = 180 height = 240>
</a>
<br>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.</li>
    <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
    <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
    <li>Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.</li>
    <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
